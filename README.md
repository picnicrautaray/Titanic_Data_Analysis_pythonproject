# Titanic_Data_Analysis_pythonproject
Project Goal :
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.

Project Description :
In this data analytics project, we aim to create a predictive model that determines whether a passenger aboard the Titanic survived or not. The dataset we will be working with contains a variety of information about each passenger, including their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin details, and their ultimate survival status.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what we'll do:

Data Collection: We will gather data from a dataset that has information about different individuals, including whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.

Data Examination: We will look at the data to understand it better. We'll check if there are any missing values and explore the information it contains.

Data Preparation: Data is often messy, so we will clean it up. This means dealing with missing values and organizing the data in a way that a computer can understand.

Building a Model: We will use a computer program (a model) to learn from the data. It will learn the patterns that suggest whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.
Testing the Model: To make sure our model works well, we will test it using a different set of data that it hasn't seen before. This will help us see how accurate our model is in making predictions.

Model Deployment: Once we are satisfied with our model's accuracy, it can be used to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.

Information about dataset attributes :
survival: 0 = No, 1 = Yes pclass : Ticket class 1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd sex : Sex Age : Age in years sibsp: No of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic parch: No of parents / children aboard the Titanic ticket: Ticket number fare: Passenger fare cabin: Cabin number embarked: Port of Embarkation C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton
